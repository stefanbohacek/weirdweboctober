in a fleeting life
some leisure time
this autumn evening
—Buson

the moon’s guidance:
please come this way
a traveler’s inn
—Basho

one leaf falls
alas! another
with the wind
—Ransetsu

cool summer breeze
a thousand green mountains
a lone temple
—Shiki

on a withered branch
sits a crow
autumn nightfall
—Basho

on this road
goes no one
autumn evening
—Basho

The stars have already
opened
their autumn eyes
—Ozaki Koyo

six in the morning—
my trip for moon-viewing
ends at dawn
—Basho

At the crescent moon
the feeling
of silence
—Chiyo-ni

spring at my hut
there is nothing...
yet, there is everything
—Sodo
